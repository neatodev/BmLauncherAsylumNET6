# Batman: Arkham Asylum - Advanced Launcher
# !OUTDATED!
# [USE THE NEW VERSION INSTEAD](https://neatodev.github.io/AsylumLauncher/)

## NO FURTHER SUPPORT WILL BE PROVIDED FOR THIS VERSION OF THE LAUNCHER!

This is a replacement application for the original BmLauncher of the game. Alongside vastly superior configuration options, this Launcher also offers:

- Tooltips for every configuration option
- Option to disable Startup Movies
- Texmod Autoload Support
- Option to boot directly into the game, skipping launcher screen
- Experimental Wine (Linux) Support (More Information at the bottom)
- Compatibility Fixes for [HD Texture Packs](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1159691355)
- NVIDIA API Implementation (Enable HBAO+ using the Launcher!) (Powered by [NvAPIWrapper](https://github.com/falahati/NvAPIWrapper))
- Extensive Logging Functionality (Powered by [NLog](https://github.com/NLog/NLog))

Works with both the Steam and EGS Version!

**This Application is built with .NET 6**. If you are using Windows 10 and above you shouldn't have any issues simply running the program. Some users might need to install [.NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) manually.

A standalone, dependency free executable is also available.


**This application has only been tested on Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and Wine. It supports the Steam, GOG and Epic Games Store version and nothing else.**

## Preview

![BMLauncher Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49599979/195911308-4c53fa9e-8f6e-49dc-a626-c5cda228498a.png)

## Installation

Drag the contents of the .zip file into the 'Batman Arkham Asylum GOTY\Binaries' folder.

To find this folder for the *Steam* version, just right-click the game in Steam, select Properties->Local Files->Browse Local Files and navigate from there.

To find it for the *EGS* version, right-click the game and select "Manage". Then click the folder icon in the "Installation" tab and navigate from there.

For the *GOG* version, click the icon next to the PLAY button and select "Manage installation->Show folder" and navigate from there.

## Usage

You can just launch your game via Steam or EGS as you normally would, though in some cases you might need to unblock the BmLauncher application for it to work properly.

To do that, just right-click the application, select Properties and enable the highlighted checkbox as seen in the image below:

![Unblock Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49599979/75610370-e2268100-5b10-11ea-978d-c257a2466dc8.png)

Once you're happy with your settings, you can skip the launcher entirely by using the `-nolauncher` launch option.

- On *Steam* you can add this in Properties->Launch options. 
- On *EGS* you can add this under Settings->Arkham Asylum->Additional Command Line Arguments. 
- On *GOG GALAXY* Customize->Manage Installation->Configure, enable Launch parameters, select Duplicate. It should be added under Additional executables.
- If you use a shortcut in Windows, right click->Properties->Shortcut and add it at the end of Target.

## Hint for Linux users

To achieve the best results when using the Launcher, you should install the Calibri font for 

Protontricks:
`protontricks 35140 -q calibri`

or

Winetricks:
`WINEPREFIX=<path-to-SteamLibrary>/steamapps/compatdata/35140/pfx winetricks -q calibri`

Furthermore, to run Arkham Asylum properly on Linux, the following fix is needed:

`protontricks 35140 -q d3dx9 d3dcompiler_43`

If you wish to make full use of PhysX for Arkham Asylum on Linux you also need to copy Arkham City's [PhysXDevice.dll](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hcM3y34HN2yLYmd1S_cV1q2MrOU6q_5w/view) into the same folder as the Launcher (Batman Arkham Asylum GOTY\Binaries).

This help section and the working Proton/Wine support was only made possible through heavy cooperation with [ThisNekoGuy](https://github.com/ThisNekoGuy).
